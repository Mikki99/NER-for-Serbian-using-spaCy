# Training and Evaluating a NER model with spaCy for Serbian

This is my final project for the course *Computational Models for Named Entity Recognition* (Uni Tuebingen, WS20/21) that was completed in cooperation with the *Serbian Association for Language Resources and Technologies (JeRTeh)*.

The project consisted of three main parts:
- Annotating an old Serbian novel according to predefined annotation guidelines
- Training a NER model with spaCy based on the previously annotated data
- Evaluating the model using different evaluation techniques (classical and novel approaches)

For a detailed explanation take a look at the ```Final Project.pdf``` file. The code is located in ```project.py```
